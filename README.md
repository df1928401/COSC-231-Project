Hello professor!

This project uses Node.js to create and run a web server that will host the application. To run the application, please:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed (can be downloaded at https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Open a terminal, `cd` into the directory of the project, then run the command `npm install` to install the project dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to compile the project
4. Run `npm run start` to start the web server. The server can then be accessed at 127.0.0.1:8080
5. To stop the server, go back to the terminal and use CTRL-C to send a kill signal, ending the process
